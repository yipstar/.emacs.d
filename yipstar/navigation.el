;; "When several buffers visit identically-named files,
;; Emacs must give the buffers distinct names. The usual method
;; for making buffer names unique adds ‘<2>’, ‘<3>’, etc. to the end
;; of the buffer names (all but one of them).
;; The forward naming method includes part of the file's directory
;; name at the beginning of the buffer name
