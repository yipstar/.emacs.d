;; TODO: after going up to root directory, restore cd to previous directory

;; Bugs: set-sdk seems to set sdk for all projects not the current one, why?

;; Goals:
;; Set Current Build Settings options:
;; Active SDK. Done.
;; Active Configuration.
;; Active Target
;; Active Executable
;; Active Architecture

;; TODO: create a function that can take the word under point and bring up xcode 
;; documentation for it.

;; TODO: make xcodebuild-compile smart, set a default build configuration and target but allow to ovveride.
;; TODO: match iphone-simulator-run to how xcode works.
